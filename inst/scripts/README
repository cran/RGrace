Here is several optional scripts not strictly required by RGrace

RGrace.Rnw - example Sweave file with RGrace graphics.

figure.startup.exmpl.R - script to build optional menus on RGrace figure. It is supposed to be called from .Rprofile file (or just before RGrace loading) to override default empty figure.startup functions. Example of my .Rprofile is in Example section of RGrace-GUI.Rd.

db.wisards.R - GUI wisards to import/export data from special MySQL database where I store my data.  

LabLog.create.sql -  the SQL script to create this mysql db.
